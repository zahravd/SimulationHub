# Production Repair System Simulation with Python

Welcome to the "SimulationHub" repository! This project focuses on simulating a production repair system for 63 machines using Python. The simulation aims to analyze the efficiency and performance of the repair system under various conditions.

In this simulation project, we model the repair system of a production environment where 63 machines are in operation. The goal is to study how different repair strategies and system configurations impact overall efficiency and downtime.

## Features

- Simulation of a production repair system with 63 machines and 7 other cars as spares.
- Implementation of various repair strategies and system configurations.
- Data collection and analysis of system efficiency and downtime.
- Python-based simulation framework for easy understanding and modification.
